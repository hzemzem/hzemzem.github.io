				<h2>About Me!</h2>
				<p>
					<img src="assets/images/gigi.jpg" width="180px" height="230px" > I'm a Moroccan girl from a small town who always dreams big and makes sure she does everything to get to where she wants. 
					I am a dream achiever who believes in hard work over luck, and I am professional when need be not by nature. I like to laugh and make people laugh. 
				</p>
				<p>
					I love traveling eventhough I only got to travel within Morocco and the U.S. My dream destinations are the places I don't know about, because I came to realize that popular cities and destinations are so overrated and often don't represent their countries. As an example, if you visited Dubai, you didn't visit UAE, because Dubai is what they want you to think UAE is. The same goes for most countries.
